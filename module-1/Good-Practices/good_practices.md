Here are some good practices that I found relevant to my coding experience and that I could apply to make changes on my pre-work, for example.

Feedback form pre-work:
	• Try to give variables a meaningful name.
	• Comment my code whenever necessary.
	• Use aliases to shorten overly long, and often-repeated chains

Pythonic Sensibilities
	• Use short variables where their meaning is clearly visible from the context.
	• Avoid get/set methods

PEP 20 - The Zen of Python (all of it)

PEP 08 (Still researching it)
