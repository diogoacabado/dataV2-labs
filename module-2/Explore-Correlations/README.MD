# Lab | Explore correlations

Using the Canadian Disaster Database (CDD.csv, can be found on the share directory), you will explore the correlations between the numerical columns in the dataset. More info on the dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/criticalhits/canadian-disaster-database#CDD.csv

1. Print the correlation matrix

2. Print a heat map of this correlation matrix (hint: use seaborn.heatmap())

3. Find 3 pairs of columns, one pair that is highly positively correlated, one for which the correlation is almost zero and one pair that is negatively correlated. In each case write down an explanation why we see this correlation

4. Look up the pairplot function in Seaborn. Use it to plot the pairwise relations between the six columns you selected. Does what you see confirm your ideas? Describe in a comment.
